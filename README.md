# ASTRAL

## Description

The repository of "Bias Mitigation in Federated Learning for Edge Computing".

## Usage
- The source code of ASTRAL and different implemented baselines and competitors, along with instructions to run the code (see ```code/README.md```) are in ```code```.
- The processed datasets used in the experiments are in ```datasets```. Each dataset repository contains 3 splits: a training set (divided into several training sets depending on FL clients number), a validation set, and a test set.
- The json configuration files to launch experiments (see ```code/README.md```) are in ```settings```. The files are organised by the section they belong to in the paper "Bias Mitigation in Federated Learning for Edge Computing".
